# Introduction

Some people who can imagine the system outlined here said that they really needed to change the way they think about the economy. It's a perspective change, but a helpful one once network effects kick in.

It is on the same alley than money. Money as a mental framework creates this ecosystem of entrepreneurs who design and operate value-producing and sustainable organizations, all held together by the goal of being profitable. And that definitely works.

What we are building is an alternative mental framework to coordinate. But instead of accounting for pairwise transactions (product <-> money), AskFi accounts for things that happened in reality (using information onboarded from various node operators), and automatically accounts for realized value creation and destruction as defined by every user individually (in a first-principle way). And this measure of value realization becomes the optimization goal of the economy. Where all participants have some form of expectation of the future, and with that an expectation of future value realization (i.e. expected value, EV). And with that perspective, each participants looks for the most +EV moves, according to their own values. All while coordinating with other participants usually yields a better result for everybody involved (i.e. cooperation, division of labour, win-win, but also conflic resolution pre- and post-mortem).

And what you will see is that money actually does not make coordination explicit. This is exactly the reason why we have receipts. To attach metadata to a monetary transaction that describes the product or service that has been bought.

The system we put forward helps in making social coordination explicit.
